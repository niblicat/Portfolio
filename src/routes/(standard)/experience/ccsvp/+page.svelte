    <p>
        I am currently working at the Center for Crime Science and Violence Prevention at SIUE's
        Belleville campus as a Software Engineer. Here, I primarily work on developing a virtual
        reality law enforcement training simulation with the goal of training officer patience and
        professionalism. I work with Unity, C#, .NET, and Google Cloud.

        My primary focus has been developing a robust dialog system that utilizes generative AI for
        NPC responses. This involves designing state machines, prompt engineering, and consuming
        REST APIs for generative AI, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text services.
