    <h2>Current Role</h2>

    <p>
        I am currently working at the Center for Crime Science and Violence Prevention at SIUE's
        Belleville campus as a Unity Software Engineer. Here, I primarily work on developing a
        virtual reality law enforcement training simulation with the goal of training officer
        patience and professionalism. I work with Unity, C#, .NET, and Google Cloud Platform.
    </p>

    <p>
        My main focus has been developing a robust dialog system that utilizes generative AI for NPC
        responses. This involves designing state machines, prompt engineering, and consuming REST
        APIs for generative AI, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text services.
