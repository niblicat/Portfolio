        <h2>Current Role</h2>

        <p>
            I am currently working at the Center for Crime Science and Violence Prevention at SIUE's
            Belleville campus as a Unity Software Engineer. Here, I primarily work on developing a
            virtual reality law enforcement training simulation with the goal of training officer
            patience and professionalism. I work with Unity, C#, .NET, and Google Cloud Platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            My main focus has been developing a robust dialog system that utilizes generative AI for NPC
            responses. This involves designing state machines, prompt engineering, and consuming REST
            APIs for generative AI, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text services.
