    <h2>What is Melon Merge 3D?</h2>

    <p>
        Melon Merge 3D is a physics puzzle game where you combine fruits into increasingly larger
        fruits. It was created mobile-first with the goal of designing the best fruit merging game
        on both major app stores. The game has been downloaded 300 times across the App Store and
        Google Play Store.

    <h2>Early Development</h2>

    />

    <p>
        Miles Wilson and I developed the game as part our final project of our Game Design,
        Development, and Technology course. This course involved learning software development
        workflows, Unity & C#, and game development fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
        The core gameplay loop was finalized during this period. Players expressed that this
        iteration sufficed as an engaging gameplay experience. The presentation, not so much.
    </p>

    <h2>Taking It Further</h2>

    <p>
        After finishing my junior year. I alone continued the development of Melon Merge 3D, aiming
        to improve the aesthetics and feedback of the game. Vibrations, particle effects, and
        physics were a must-have. Additionally, the fruits could not be spheres with a stock fruit
        texture slapped on.
    </p>
    <p>
        I learned Maya and brushed up on my Photoshop skills to model and paint each fruit, the
        background elements. I used Illustrator to design the vector graphs like icons and UI
        elements. Fruits like the pineapple and cantaloupe took a few revisions to design just
        right, as I really wanted the fruits to look as fruity as possible. Overall, I'm quite proud
        of what I accomplished. Only a few visual assets, like the music and skybox, were not
        directly designed by me.
    </p>

    <h2>Release</h2>

    />

    <p>
        The next big hurdle was releasing the game on app stores. Releasing the game on the App
        Store was as challenging as registering and paying for an Apple Developer account and
        publishing for approval on App Store Connect. However, the Google Play Store would prove to
        be a tougher challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Google instituted a 20-tester requirement to distribute on the play store. This meant I
        would need to find 20 people with an Android phone willing to download my game, play the
        game and not uninstall the game within two weeks. To find my testers, I asked professors if
        I could preview my game in for brief periods during classes. Sure enough, after about two
        classes, I had enough Android users to apply for distribution on the Google Play Store!
    </p>

    <h2>What Now?</h2>

    <p>
        Although the game is at a complete state, I wouldn't mind working on this project again.
        There are so many features I could add, like saves, a leaderboard, and new modes, but it's
        difficult to justify spending the time on those features over working on other projects or
        learning new skills. If I were to return to this project, I would also try refactoring many
        of the core systems, as they were not developed with future me's sanity in mind. We'll see
        if I return to Melon Merge 3D!
