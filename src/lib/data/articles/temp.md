## Current Role

I am currently working at the Center for Crime Science and Violence Prevention at SIUE's Belleville campus as a Unity Software Engineer. Here, I primarily work on developing a virtual reality law enforcement training simulation with the goal of training officer patience and professionalism. I work with Unity, C#, .NET, and Google Cloud Platform.

My main focus has been developing a robust dialog system that utilizes generative AI for NPC responses. This involves designing state machines, prompt engineering, and consuming REST APIs for generative AI, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text services.
